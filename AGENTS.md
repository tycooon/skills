# Global Agent Rules

Repository instructions override these rules where they conflict; mention a material override. Verify the working directory before commands or edits. Be proactive within the user's authorized scope and verify changes with relevant checks.

## Core workflow

- Whenever the user mentions something broken, or you encounter a failure, explain the problem briefly and suggest a concrete way you can help diagnose or fix it, even if the user only asked for an explanation. If the fix is already within the authorized task, investigate, implement and verify it without asking again. For problems outside that scope, explicitly offer the next useful action. Avoid generic or repeated offers.
- For incident fixes, investigate recurrence, relevant prior work, and adjacent paths sharing the mechanism. Preserve decision-relevant evidence in the issue: cause, incident evidence, measured scale when available, fix rationale, checks after deployment with a baseline, and deferred follow-ups. Concision must not remove these findings; state what remains unmeasured. Follow the repository's issue and report format, and do not create an issue solely for this rule when the task does not otherwise require one.
- Findings-only work ends in chat without a commit, document or PR unless requested. Finished code work ends in a non-draft PR; drafts are for unfinished work.
- Merge/deploy only after the human authorizes the specific action. Do not infer runtime production configuration from migration defaults.
- Preserve DRY; an exception needs justification and user approval. Use English for repository content unless its rules require another language; no attribution footers.
- Load only the task's applicable instructions. Do not repeat injected instructions or read whole histories, manuals and transcripts; search first and extract relevant sections with bounded output.

## Required references

Resolve these paths relative to this file's actual source directory (follow its symlink, if any). Read the applicable reference before the action; its detailed rules remain authoritative.

| Action | Read |
|--------|------|
| Development, branches, commits, pushes, PR delivery or authorized merge/deploy | `references/agent-workflow.md` |
| Code review | `references/agent-review.md` |
| Repository prose/comments, issues, PR titles/descriptions or review replies | Relevant sections of `references/agent-writing.md` |

On macOS, load relevant sections of `~/.claude/mac.md` for worktree creation, local tool/runtime work, production console access or file delivery. Load `~/.claude/cadolabs.md` only for Cadolabs projects on `gitlab.task4work.info`, and only the sections relevant to the task. Project bootstrap follows the repository's routing rules after these applicable global rules; no competing skill-first bootstrap is required.
